# How to use?

	git clone https://gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/vagrawal/cluster-jobs.git

There are (atleast) three folders of interest.

* ~/cluster-jobs
* ~/your_repo(s)_which_contains_your_code_to_run_and_data
* ~/jobs (if this doesn't exist, mkdir it)


### Jobs folder

* Everytime you submit a job (i.e. python3 create_job.py â€¦..), a new subfolder is created (for that bunch of jobs)
*
